Questions about CoarseFineTransformations
- What the tr number means?
- What old_redges is?
- Do we need to fill the 3rd order information inherited from Densor with stuff?
- GetPointMatrix what is the shift doing?

# Needed info from MFEM
- Global index (for relating different instances of the same node on different processes)
- Ownership (which process owns the node)
- Which elements are marked for refinement

 # Returned info 
- New elements (in full new mesh)
- New nodes with global indices and ownership

# Interpolator (together)
- Mesh linear interpolator

# example code

Mesh * m = original_mesh;
## Outside solution loop
SMBisection bisection(m);

	## inside solution loop

	### Option 2
	bisection.refine(elems) // Array with the global (convert to local) indices of the elements to refine

	m = bisection.get_mesh();
